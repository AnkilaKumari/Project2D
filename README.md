# Project2D 

This map visualizes optimized emergency response routes across a designated urban area, focusing on minimizing response times for fire, medical, and police services. It highlights critical infrastructure such as hospitals, fire stations, and high-risk zones, while also incorporating real-time traffic and road network data. The intended audience includes emergency management officials, city planners, and first responders who rely on rapid decision-making during crises. The map is used in planning and operational contexts to improve emergency preparedness, ensure equitable service coverage, and support real-time routing during active incidents.
